#Tank Battle!
What is it?!
Tank Battle! is an open-world tank game. The player will get a 3rd person view, and the aim is to get in reach of your enemy and to shoot them down before you get shot down!

What is needed?
- An open-world terrain, with hills, terraces and some flat terrain. There should be some trees, bushes and grass on some parts and some rocks in the wild bit enough to go behind with your tank. Very high mountains from stopping the player from escaping at the end of the map. It should take MAX 15 seconds to get from one side to the other side to make it relatively quick
- Walls and houses where you can hide in or behind with your tank. There should be 2 types with walls, one full and one with a part of the top missing so you can fire through it, but it  MUST be POSSIBLE to get HIT on the half high wall
- Sound! A Tank gun firing, a tank moving, a tank being hit and 1/2/3 background music tracks(These  tracks should be giving tention and a battle like feeling, NOT relaxing)
- A 3d model of 1 tank, with 2 different skins (to make them different without possibly exploiting an advantage for the other player or you) (If possible an as easy model for a colider to optimize performance)
- Menu assets: Buttons, a logo and menu music (different from in-game music)
- Shells, both 2d for selecting them (optional) and 3d when firing, also a muzzle flash

What are the controlls?
- A gamepad (1 stick for aiming the gun, 1 stick for steering the tank; One of the back buttons for firing)
~ Possibly a mouse and keyboard (mouse will control where the gun points and keyboard will stear it; Mouse buttons for firing)

When do you win?
- When the other player is shot down by you
